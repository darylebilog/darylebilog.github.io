  🎓 I hold a Master of Science in Business Analytics from the Davis Eccles School of Business at the University of Utah, and I began my journey with a Business Management degree focused on Marketing at Brigham Young University - Hawaii.
  <br><br>
  💻 I’m passionate about using SQL, R, and Python for data analysis to uncover trends and drive decisions, and I create engaging dashboards in Tableau, Looker Studio, and Marketing Cloud Intelligence.
  <br><br>
  🌍 Outside of data, I enjoy singing and hiking in nature, and I believe in lifelong learning and the joy of discovering something new!
