  🎓 I’m a proud graduate with a Master of Science in Business Analytics from the fantastic Davis Eccles School of Business at the University of Utah! My journey started with an undergraduate degree in Business Management—where I focused on Marketing and dabbled in Information Systems, Math, and even Theater—at Brigham Young University - Hawaii.
  <br><br>
  💻 I’m all about the numbers and insights! With a toolkit that includes SQL, R, and Python, I thrive on analyzing data to uncover trends and drive decision-making. I love crafting eye-catching dashboards in Tableau, Looker Studio, and Marketing Cloud Intelligence. Collaboration is my jam, and I thrive on working with others to turn data into actionable magic.
  <br><br>
  🌍 When I am not diving into data, you can find me belting out my favorite tunes or hitting the trails to explore the breathtaking wonders of nature. I believe in lifelong learning—there is always something new to discover, and I am here for it!
