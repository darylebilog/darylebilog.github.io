  <p align = "justify">
  🎓 I hold a Master of Science in Business Analytics from the Davis Eccles School of Business at the University of Utah, and I earned my undergraduate degree in Business Management with a focus on Marketing at Brigham Young University - Hawaii.
  <br><br>
  💻 I specialize in data analysis using SQL, R, and Python to uncover trends and drive decision-making. I enjoy creating engaging dashboards in Tableau, Looker Studio, and Marketing Cloud Intelligence, and I thrive on collaboration to turn data into actionable insights.
  <br><br>
  🌍 When I’m not immersed in data, you can find me singing my heart out or exploring the great outdoors. I’m a lifelong learner, always eager to discover something new!
